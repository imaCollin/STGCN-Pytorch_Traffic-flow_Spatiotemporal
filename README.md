# STGNN-Pytorch_Traffic-flow_Spatiotemporal
## Characteristics:
The proposed model represents a pioneering approach in traffic research by employing pure convolutional layers (TCN) to simultaneously extract spatial-temporal information from time series of graph structures. It introduces a novel neural network architecture comprising spatio-temporal blocks. Due to the exclusive use of convolution operations, this architecture exhibits training speeds over 10 times faster than RNN-based models and requires fewer parameters. Moreover, it enables more efficient handling of larger road networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed network on two real traffic datasets.
## Network Skeleton:
The STGCN architecture consists of multiple space-time convolution blocks, each exhibiting a "sandwich" structure comprising two gate sequence convolution layers sandwiching a spatial graph convolution layer. In terms of its component structure, STGCN comprises two fast ST-Conv blocks (light blue section) and a fully connected output layer (green section), wherein each ST-Conv block encompasses two time convolution blocks (orange section) and one spatial convolution block (light yellow section).

Figure of STGCN
The Graph convolutional neural network that extracts time features is the Spatial Graph-conv module in the corresponding network structure. The graph convolutional neural network that extracts spatial features is the Temporal Gated-Conv module in the corresponding network structure. Hence, the ST-Conv Block formula provides an alternative interpretation of the figure. Initially, the input data undergoes convolution in the time dimension, followed by convolution in the graph dimension for the output result. Subsequently, a RELU activation is applied to the output of graph convolution, and finally, a convolution operation is performed in the time dimension to obtain the overall output of the ST-Conv Block.
The eventual model consists of two stacked St-Conv blocks followed by an output layer. The output layer combines the temporal dimension of the previous output data with the convolution of the temporal dimension, and then generates the final prediction data through a convolution.
